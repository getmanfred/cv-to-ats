Analyze the following CV and return ONLY valid JSON — no markdown, no text outside the JSON object.

─── SCORING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Required top-level fields:

- "nombre": only the person's first name extracted from the CV (no surnames).

- "saludo": 2-4 sentence paragraph in the specified language. The first sentence is a casual, direct greeting using the person's name, followed by a quick score assessment. The following sentences highlight the CV's strengths and then the main issues lowering the ATS score. Use gender-neutral language. Be specific and mention concrete elements from the CV. When mentioning skills or technologies, reflect the CV's stated proficiency level exactly — never upgrade or downgrade it. If the CV qualifies a skill as "autodidacta", "aprendizaje propio", "familiar", "básico" or equivalent, preserve that qualifier. Official certifications always indicate verified, demonstrable expertise and must be reflected as such.

- "saludoTerminos": array of 2-5 exact substrings from the "saludo" field that represent the most important technical terms or concrete problems to highlight in bold (they must appear literally in "saludo"). Do not include the person's name.

- "headline": short technical phrase (max 15 words) about the ATS state of the CV in the specified language.

- "skillsDetectadas": array of detected technologies, tools and technical skills in the CV. Max 15 items, no duplicates, no descriptions — just the name (e.g. "React", "Python", "Figma", "SQL"). Use the canonical English name for technologies regardless of CV language. Prioritise skills backed by certifications or extensive work experience over skills only mentioned as self-taught or familiar. Normalise certification codes to the technology name (e.g. "AZ-900", "AZ-104", "AZ-305" → "Azure"; "AWS SAA-C03", "AWS-DVA" → "AWS"; "CKA", "CKAD" → "Kubernetes"; "GCP ACE" → "GCP"). If the 15-item limit is reached, drop self-taught mentions before dropping certified or heavily-used skills.

- "metricas": object with:
  - "palabras": approximate total word count of the CV
  - "paginasEstimadas": estimated number of pages (1–4)
  - "densidadKeywords": percentage of ATS-relevant keywords over total words (0–100)

- "alertasCriticas": array of strings in the specified language describing severe issues that can cause ATS parsing failures. Only include real problems detected in the text (e.g. photo detected, multiple columns, complex tables, decorative special characters, URLs with spaces). Empty array [] if no critical alerts.

- "gapsCarrera": array of strings in the specified language describing detected employment gaps of 6 months or more. Rules:
  1. A gap exists ONLY when there is a period with NO employment at all between two consecutive roles.
  2. CURRENT ROLES: any role whose end date is "Present", "Actual", "Actualidad", "Current", "Hoy", "a la actualidad", or equivalent means the person is STILL employed there — treat it as active through TODAY. Never flag a gap leading up to a current role.
  3. MISSING END DATE ≠ GAP: if a role has no end date listed but is clearly the most recent or current role, do NOT flag a gap — assume it is ongoing.
  4. OVERLAPPING ROLES: overlapping date ranges between two or more roles are NOT a gap — they represent simultaneous employment (e.g. a freelance role running in parallel with a full-time job).
  5. Before flagging any gap, verify that no other role's date range covers that period.
  6. Each string must name the specific gap period (e.g. "8 meses sin actividad laboral entre Empresa X (mar 2021) y Empresa Y (nov 2021)").
  Return empty array [] if no significant gaps are clearly confirmed. When in doubt, return []. This is informational only — do NOT alter category scores because of gaps.

- "topPriorities": array of 3 concrete actions in the specified language (infinitive phrases, gender-neutral). Each must reference something specific found (or missing) in this CV — a real section, skill, job title, or gap. Never write a priority that could apply to any CV.

─── CATEGORIES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Evaluate these 6 categories using the scoring criteria below. For each, produce:
- "category": category name in the specified language
- "score": number 0-100 (apply criteria mechanically — count exactly, do not estimate)
- "status": "good" (≥75), "needs-work" (50-74) or "critical" (<50)
- "summary": one direct sentence about the state of this area in the specified language
- "suggestions": improvement suggestions for this category (see SUGGESTIONS section below)

Scoring criteria:

1. Keywords & skills — count each unique, explicitly named technology, programming language, framework, library, database, cloud platform, DevOps/MLOps tool, named methodology (e.g. Scrum, Kanban), or professional certification. Each item counts once regardless of how often it appears. Do NOT count: generic soft skills ("communication", "leadership"), job titles, industry names, vague phrases ("web technologies", "cloud experience"), or generic office tools ("Microsoft Office", "Excel", "Word", "PowerPoint", "Google Suite", "Google Docs"). Do NOT count "agile" or "scrum" unless they appear as a named practice in a specific project context or certification — a bare mention of "metodología ágil" does not count. STRICT: if doubtful whether something qualifies, do NOT count it. A CV that only mentions 3–4 specific tools must score 35–54, not higher.
   - 85–100: 15+ distinct items | 70–84: 10–14 | 55–69: 6–9 | 35–54: 3–5 | <35: 0–2

2. Format & parseability — start at 75. Apply deductions only for confirmed, unambiguous issues. When in doubt, do NOT deduct.
   - Two or more text columns running side by side (not a simple two-cell table): −35
   - Main content inside merged-cell tables (not simple bordered boxes): −25
   - CV text exists only as embedded images (no selectable text at all): −60
   - Non-standard decorative characters used as the sole bullet style (★, ⬛, custom glyphs — not "•" or "-"): −10
   If none of the above apply, score exactly 75. Do not invent penalties.

3. Work experience — evaluate TWO aspects together:
   A) Structure per role: company name present? Job title present? Start date present? End date or "present" present? At least one description line present? Count total omissions across all roles. NOTE: overlapping date ranges across roles are valid and expected (e.g. a freelance or autonomous role running in parallel with a full-time position) — do not treat them as omissions or errors.
   B) Bullet quality: do descriptions include specific numbers, percentages, team sizes, project scope, revenue/cost figures, or measurable outcomes? OR are they purely vague ("responsible for", "in charge of", "helped with", "worked on", "supported", "participated in", "collaborated on")?

   Score combining both aspects:
   - 85–100: 0 structural omissions AND the majority of bullets contain specific metrics or measurable outcomes
   - 70–84: 0–2 omissions AND some concrete details are present in the descriptions
   - 50–69: 3–5 omissions OR all/most bullets are vague with no measurable outcomes
   - <50: 6+ omissions OR descriptions are absent or consist entirely of vague phrases with no substance

4. Education & certifications — institution name + degree/qualification + year = complete entry.
   - 85–100: ≥1 complete entry + certifications if listed | 65–84: complete entry, no certs | 50–64: partial entries | <50: sparse or absent

5. Contact information — email (+25 pts), phone (+25 pts), city/country (+25 pts), LinkedIn or portfolio URL (+25 pts). Score = sum of present elements × 25. Apply mechanically.

6. Length & file optimization — based on estimated page count only.
   - 90–100: 1–2 pages | 70–84: 3 pages | 45–69: 4 pages | <45: 5+ pages or under 200 words

─── SUGGESTIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

For each category, write exactly 2 improvement suggestions. Each must follow this structure:
- "titulo": short actionable title in the specified language
- "pasos": exactly 2 steps, each with:
  - "texto": concrete step in 1-2 sentences naming specific CV content
- "prioridad": "alta" if category score < 60, "media" if 60–74, "baja" if ≥ 75
- "sugerencia": max 30-word copy-paste text example showing improved content — ONLY include this for "alta" priority suggestions, set null for "media" and "baja"

SUGGESTION RULES:
1. ANTI-HALLUCINATION — CRITICAL: Before naming any company, job title, skill, or technology in a suggestion, verify it appears WORD-FOR-WORD in the CV text above. If you cannot find it literally in the text, use a generic reference ("tu rol más reciente", "la empresa anterior") — NEVER invent, guess, or paraphrase names. A suggestion referencing a company or skill that does not exist in the CV is a critical failure.
2. Every step must reference something real and specific from THIS CV. Generic steps that could apply to any CV are forbidden.
3. Forbidden patterns: "Add more keywords", "Quantify achievements", "Ensure contact info is complete", "Use ATS-friendly format", "Tailor to job description".
4. Each suggestion tackles a DIFFERENT problem. No duplicates across the entire response.
5. NEVER suggest changing dates, employment years, or graduation years — all dates are historical facts.
6. NEVER reorder work experience if the most recent position already appears first.
7. NEVER suggest removing the candidate's name without providing an alternative placement.

─── CALIBRATION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Score strictly. Most real-world CVs should score between 40–70. Reserve 80+ for genuinely strong CVs. When in doubt between two bands, always pick the lower one.

Concrete anchors — apply these directly:
- Keywords: a CV with only 3–4 named tools must score 35–54. A CV with no dedicated skills section and only incidental tool mentions must score <35. Do not inflate.
- Experience: a role that has all structural fields present (company, title, dates, description) but all bullets are vague ("responsible for", "worked on", "participated in") → score 50–69, never higher. Only score 70+ if at least some bullets include concrete details. Only score 85+ if the majority of bullets contain specific numbers, scope, and measurable impact.
- Education: no certifications and education section has only institution + degree but no year → score 50–64, not higher.
- Contact: missing phone OR missing location → deduct the corresponding 25 pts. Do not assume fields are present.

─── IMPORTANT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Ignore platform-generated metadata, template branding, page numbers, or website footers (e.g. 'getmanfred.com', 'BUT WAIT', repeated decorative separators, standalone page numbers). Do not penalise the CV for this content.
- ALL generated text must be in the SAME language as specified.
- FIDELITY TO STATED LEVELS: Never infer an expertise level beyond what the CV explicitly states. The CV's own qualifiers ("certified", "autodidacta", "learning", "familiar with", "básico", "en progreso") are ground truth — do not override them.
